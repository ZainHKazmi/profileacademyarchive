<p>Small business owners can&rsquo;t afford to ignore Facebook.</p>
<p>Nearly all consumers use the Web to search for local businesses &ndash; and most of them are on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5435-facebook-starred-reviews-business-pages.html">Facebook</a>. The website is the biggest social networking platform in the world by far, with more than a billion active users.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the social media giant is steadily rolling out features to help users find small businesses, while helping small businesses connect with potential new customers.</p>
<p>A good Facebook presence can help you engage your fans and grow your business. But with so many ways to promote your business on Facebook, it&rsquo;s hard to know where to start.</p>
<h2 class="nolinks"><strong>1. Create your Page</strong></h2>
<p>Your Facebook Page is your business&rsquo; home base on the social networking site. A Page is a lot like a regular Facebook profile, but for brands and businesses.</p>

Boost your brand and create sales with Facebook marketing. Here's how.</div>

<p>With a 13-year track record of helping network marketing organizations and small businesses achieve unprecedented growth, Jim Lupkin decided it was time to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.socialmediadirectsales.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">share his strategies</a>&nbsp;with the world. He turned to best-selling author,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.briancartergroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brian Carter</a>.<span class="_5yl5">&nbsp;Carter, trusted by brands like NBC, Microsoft, and PrideStaff, has guided businesses to 800 percent profits and higher with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/how-to-make-money-on-facebook.html">Facebook marketing</a>.</span></p>
<p>After reading Lupkin's case study on a network marketing company that grew over seventy-million in sales with his approach, Carter knew it was time for the pair to co-author a book. The authors are quick to mention, however, that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.socialmediadirectsales.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Network Marketing For Facebook&nbsp;</em></a>is not valuable to only the network marketing industry. "We were not surprised to hear that sales professionals and entrepreneurs love the book too," says Carter. "These techniques will work for your business if your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/how-to-make-your-customers-fall-in-love-with-your-brand.html">personal brand</a>&nbsp;is part of the sales process."</p>
<p>Why Facebook you may ask? "Wouldn't it make sense to join the community with the most people?" says Lupkin. "Facebook has more than one billion users and is five times more popular than the next most popular social network."</p>
<p>Here's just a taste of what you'll find inside the cover of&nbsp;<em>Network Marketing For Facebook.</em></p>

<p>When someone knows, likes and trusts you, they're more willing to hear about your business.

<h1>Guide For Choosing The Best Facebook Profile Picture [Flowchart]</h1>
<p>You can tell a lot about a person from his or her Facebook profile picture.

It turns out, there may be more psychology embedded in that Facebook photo than you realize.
